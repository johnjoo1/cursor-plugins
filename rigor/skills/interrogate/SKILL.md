# Interrogate

Spawn several reviewers to adversarially review code changes. Each gets the same prompt and rubric, and a distinct review lens.

**Read this before you weigh the verdict.** The original version of this skill drew its signal from *vendor* diversity: reviewers on different model families fail differently, so independent agreement was strong evidence. Here every reviewer is a Claude model, so their errors correlate. Distinct lenses help, but personas are a weaker substitute than genuinely different weights.

What that means in practice:

- Agreement across same-family reviewers is **moderate** evidence, not high-confidence signal. Two reviewers sharing a blind spot will agree confidently and both be wrong.
- A lone finding still deserves a read. Correlated reviewers under-produce disagreement, so a single dissent is worth more here than the count suggests.
- Consensus never substitutes for tracing the execution path yourself (Step 5).

The deliverable is a synthesized verdict. Do NOT auto-apply changes.

## Step 1, Determine Scope

Identify what to review from context:

- If the user points at specific files or a diff, use that
- If on a feature branch, run `git diff main...HEAD` (or the appropriate base branch) for the full changeset
- If the user's message references recent work, gather the relevant files

Package the diff (or file contents) plus any surrounding context files the reviewers need to understand the code.

## Step 2, State the Intent

Before spawning reviewers, state the intent explicitly. What is this code trying to accomplish? Derive this from:

- The user's message
- Commit messages
- PR description if one exists
- The code itself

Write one clear paragraph. Reviewers challenge whether the work achieves the intent well, not whether the intent itself is correct. If you're unsure about the intent, ask the user before proceeding.

## Step 3, Spawn Reviewers

Launch all reviewers in a single message using the `Agent` tool, each with a distinct lens.

<!-- REVIEWERS: edit this block to change the roster. See rigor/README.md for the cross-vendor opt-in. -->

| Reviewer | Model | Lens |
|----------|-------|------|
| A | `opus` | Correctness. Trace execution paths; edge cases, error handling, state, concurrency, idempotency. |
| B | `opus` | Structure. Boundary discipline, coupling, data-model fit, bolted-on vs. integrated, legacy dual-paths. |
| C | `sonnet` | Code quality. The `references/code-quality-review.md` lens: code-judo simplifications, spaghetti growth, file size. |
| D | `sonnet` | Security and verification. Traced input-to-sink paths only; test coverage of the changed behavior. |

For each reviewer:
- `subagent_type`: `"Explore"` (read-only; reviewers must not edit)
- `model`: from the table
- `run_in_background`: `true`

Give each its lens explicitly. The lens narrows what it leads with; it still reviews through any rubric section it finds relevant.

**Cross-vendor reviewer (optional).** If a cross-vendor reviewer is configured, add it as Reviewer E on the correctness lens. It is the only genuinely decorrelated arm, so weight its agreement with a Claude reviewer more heavily than agreement among the Claude reviewers themselves. It is a one-shot completion, not an agent, so it sees only the diff and rubric you pass it and cannot explore the codebase. With none configured, run the four above and apply the correlation caveat.

Read `references/reviewer-prompt.md` and fill in the template with:
1. The stated intent
2. The diff or file contents
3. The review rubric from `references/rubric.md`
4. The code-quality lens from `references/code-quality-review.md`

The same filled template goes to all reviewers, so every model applies the code-quality lens.

Each reviewer produces structured findings as described in the prompt template.

## Step 4, Synthesize

As results come back, build a unified picture:

1. **Parse all findings** from the reviewers
2. **Identify consensus**. Findings raised by 2+ reviewers independently are the strongest signal available here, but see the correlation caveat above: same-family agreement is moderate evidence, not proof.
3. **Identify lone findings**. Worth reading. Correlated reviewers under-produce disagreement, so a lone dissent carries more weight than its count implies.
4. **Deduplicate**. Different models may describe the same issue differently. Merge these and note which models raised it.
5. **Note disagreements**. If one model flags something and another explicitly says the opposite, that's useful context for the verdict.

## Step 5, Lead Judgment

You are the lead reviewer, a pragmatic senior engineer, not a neutral aggregator.

Read `references/lead-judgment.md` for the full framework. Reviewers only see a slice of the codebase. You have the full context (the goal, the constraints, the timeline, which tradeoffs were already considered). Use that context aggressively.

Categorize every finding using these buckets:

- **Act on**. Real issues affecting correctness, security, or maintainability given the actual goals. These would block a real PR.
- **Consider**. Legitimate points, but you're not sure they outweigh the cost of addressing them right now. Worth the user's attention.
- **Noted**. Technically valid but not actionable. Context-dependent, premature optimization, or low-impact given the current stage.
- **Dismissed**. Wrong, nitpicky, or missing context. Brief explanation why.

For each finding, include:
- Which model(s) raised it
- The category (act on / consider / noted / dismissed)
- A one-line rationale for the categorization

## Output Format

Present the verdict in this structure:

### Intent
> [The stated intent paragraph from Step 2]

### Reviewers
- Reviewer [label]: [model name], [N findings] (one bullet per reviewer)

### Act On
[Findings that should be addressed. For each: description, which models raised it, why it matters.]

### Consider
[Findings worth thinking about. For each: description, which models raised it, tradeoff involved.]

### Noted
[Valid but low-priority. Brief list.]

### Dismissed
[Rejected findings with brief rationale. This shows the user what was filtered out and why, so they can override your judgment if they disagree.]

### Agreement Map
[Where did reviewers agree, where did they diverge, and what does the pattern tell us? State whether any cross-vendor reviewer took part; if not, say that agreement here is same-family and correlated.]
